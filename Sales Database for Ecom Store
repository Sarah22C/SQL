--This is a project where I had to query a database of monthly customer sales.

--1. How many products were sold in Los Angeles in February, and how many of each were sold?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

--2. Which location in New York received at least 3 separate orders in January? How many orders did each of those locations receive?

SELECT distinct location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderID)=6
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID)>2;
