--This is a project where I had to query a database of monthly customer sales.

--1. How many products were sold in Los Angeles in February, and how many of each were sold?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

--2. Which location in New York received at least 3 separate orders in January? How many orders did each of those locations receive?

SELECT distinct location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderID)=6
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID)>2;

--3. What was the average amount spent, averaging in all the customer accounts. (Not how much each account averaged)
SELECT SUM(quantity*price) /count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
on Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4. What product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY revenue desc
LIMIT 1;
